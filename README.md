# MY FIRST VUE APP

This application uses [Single File Components](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html) (components that are defined individually in files ending with a `.vue` extension as opposed to a `.js` file using the `new Vue({ el: '#container' })` syntax). This is made possible by using a build tool like Browserify, or in our case, Webpack.

Kick it off:
`npm run dev`


### WEBPACK (4)
* no need to specify `entry` in `webpack.config` -- the default is `index.js`
